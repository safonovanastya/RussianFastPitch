In order to make a prosody controllable TTS model for Russian, the *FastPitch* and *WaveGlow* models were trained on Russian data. Additionally, a post-processing script was written to create one of 6 intonational constructions (IC), which were described by Elena Bryzgunova in 1960-s and are widely used in Russian academic linguistics society.

## Training

One can get all detailed information about *FastPitch* model on [the official website](https://fastpitch.github.io/) or [GitHub repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/SpeechSynthesis/FastPitch). Details about the *WaveGlow* model is on the [official GitHub repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/waveglow).

### FastPitch

The *FastPitch* model was trained on [RUSLAN](https://ruslan-corpus.github.io/) dataset with following hyperparameters: GPU numbers = 4, batch size = 16, gradient accumulation = 4, learning rate = 0.1. The AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision) mechanism have not used. 1000 epoches have been trained. The loss function values according to the number of trained epochs and the model's language could be found below. The figures of LJSpeech were taken from [the official FastPitch GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/SpeechSynthesis/FastPitch) for results comparison.

### WaveGlow

The *WaveGlow* model was trained on [RUSLAN](https://ruslan-corpus.github.io/) dataset using 4 GPU with basic hyperparameters: batch size = 4, segment length = 8000. The AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision) mechanism have not used. 550 epoches have been trained. The loss function values according to the number of trained epochs and the model's language can be found below.

## Data

The dataset [Ruslan](https://ruslan-corpus.github.io/) was used to train both models. Text transcripts are stored in the folder `filelists`. The lists of all wav files and its' transcripts divided into training and validation samples can be found in `ruslan_train.txt` and `ruslan_val.txt` files in turn. There are the same information with an additional reference to the pitch files (which can be obtained after data preprocessing) in `ruslan_pitch_train.txt` and `ruslan_pitch_val.txt` files. The `short_ruslan_train.txt`, `short_ruslan_val.txt`, `short_pitch_ruslan_train.txt` and `short_pitch_ruslan_val.txt` files contain cuted audio lists with transcripts (all those audio whose transcript length is less than 200 characters) for faster training of the models.

## Post-processing
### About intonational constructions
IC is a minimal intonational unit which determines the phrase meaning. It is traditionally to distinguish 6 types of intonation constructions, which are differing in the pitch movement on the five phrase parts: beginning, pre-accent, accent syllable, post-accent and final. Below one can find short descriptions with pictures showing all types of ICs (the accent syllable is highlighted with dotted lines).
1. **The 1st IC**: a marginal pitch fall. It is typical for completed narrative sentence

2. **The 2nd IC**: a sharp pitch decrease with a slight rise in the pre-accent part. This type of intonation uses in interrogative sentences with a question word, appeals and expressions of will.

3. **The 3rd IC**: an ascending tone followed by a fall. Is used in general question, enumeration or incompleteness.

4. **The 4th IC**: a descending-ascending pitch. It is used in incomplete interrogative sentences with a comparative union and enumerations (like IC-3).

5. **The 5th IC**: it has two accents â€“ a pitch rise on the first accent, decrease on the second accent with a leveling off in between. It is typical for sentences that convey a bright degree of expression of any feature.

6. **The 6th IC**: an rising tone, followed by a high-level retention. It is used in evaluative exclamations and expressions of bewilderment.

### About the post-processing code

The post-processing code can be found in jupyter notebook `notebooks/FastPitch_voice_modification_custom.ipynb`. The algorithm averages the originally generated intonation by a factor of 1.5 (the value was set experimentally) in order to smooth the synthesized accents. Also, the lower and upper boundaries of the pitch were set, 80 and 300 Hz. These values were chosen based on the speaker's average pitch (about 110 Hz). The next step was setting a certain pitch level for each sound, according to the given intonational contour. The algorithm determines all the desired intervals for each type of IC (beginning, pre-accent, accent, post-accent and final) and sets the specified pitch level.


## Results
Examples of pure generated phrases and the same phrases with post-processing based on Bryzgunova's intonation constructions division are stored in the `audio` folder. A preference test was conducted: 300 people have listened to each received example pair (generating by TTS without post-processing & with post-processing) and answered the question "which audio sounds more natural?" (using [Yandex Toloka](https://toloka.yandex.ru/)). The test results are below:


|     Number of votes     |  IC-1 |  IC-2 | IC-3  |  IC-4 |  IC-5 |  IC-6 |
|:------------------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| without post-processing | 1058  |  1036 |  676  |  599  |  891  | 1005  |
| with post-processing    | 442   |  464  |  824  |  901  |  609  |  495  |

It could be noticed, that in most cases users preferred pure generated intonation without additional modification, except for sentences with IC-3 and IC-4. Such an exception could be explained by the fact that both intonation contours entails rising pitch in question sentences, which the speech synthesizer itself does not generate well. Mostly, it syntheses these kind of question phrases with marginaly descending pitch level, and it could seems inappropriate to native speakers. FastPitch plausibly generates affirmative sentences, and this fact is reflected in the survey results. In addition, it could be noted that among all the affirmative statements, those with IC-5 have the smallest preference difference: 891 for the original versus 609 for the modification. This might results from the fact that this IC performs more of an emotional function than a syntactic one, unlike IC-1 and IC-2, and the model also does emotional coloring poorly. However, this is not observed with IC-6, which is close to IC-5 in meaning.


# How to run the code

### Manual for generating phrases with a specified intonation construction

In order to generate a phrase with the necessary specified IC (intonation construction), you need to follow several steps:

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/safonovanastya/Russian_FastPitch_modified_intonation.git
   cd Russian_FastPitch_modified_intonation/
   ```

2. Build and run the FastPitch PyTorch NGC container.

   ```bash
   bash scripts/docker/build.sh
   bash scripts/docker/interactive.sh
   ```

3. Download pre-trained FastPitch Ð¸ WaveGlow models.

   ```bash
   bash scripts/download_fastpitch.sh
   bash scripts/download_waveglow.sh
   ```
   
4. Write in `phrases/text.txt` file a phrase, specifying the accents in the words (with the + symbol) and the phrasal accent (with the ++ symbol). Please note that for all IC, except IC-5, you must specify one phrasal accent. For the IC-5, you must indicate two phrasal accents.

5. Start the generation process by setting an additional parameter `--pitch-transform-custom` with the IR number.

   ```bash
   python ../inference.py --cuda --fastpitch ../output_fastpitch/FastPitch_checkpoint_1000.pt --waveglow ../output_waveglow/checkpoint_WaveGlow_450.pt --wn-channels 256 --p-arpabet 0.0 -i phrases/text.txt -o ../output/modified_ik4/ --pitch-transform-custom 4
   ```
   
   Or run the code from jupyter notebook `notebooks/FastPitch_voice_modification_custom.ipynb`

Examples of generating phrases based on Bryzgunova's intonation constructions can be found in the folder `audio`.
